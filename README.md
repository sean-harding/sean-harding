- Hi, I’m Sean Harding, a PhD student at the University of Bristol
- I’m interested in the electronic structure of strongly correlated materials
- See SIAM_tb_solver and TIAM_tb_solver for PhD project code written in Python for many-body physics of quantum systems
- See the Teaching/"rocket.cpp" and lattice_boltzmann for example C++ code
